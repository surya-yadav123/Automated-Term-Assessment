- 🧮 **Automatic calculation** of final scores based on weighted components.  
- 🏅 **Grade assignment** based on final scores.  
- 📊 **Generation of detailed performance reports** for each student.  
- 💾 **Persistent data storage** using file handling for saving and loading student records.  

This project aims to **reduce manual effort**, **improve accuracy**, and provide a **structured and consistent evaluation** mechanism for academic term work assessment.
